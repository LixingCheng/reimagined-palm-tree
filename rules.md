# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Split up the tasks evenly, communicate who is doing what tasks, ensure that no one is doing significantly more work than others

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Periodically update team members on progress on all tasks. Leave descriptive commit comments so it's clear what has been accomplished.



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Everyone let other team members know his or her difficulties with the task using the group texting, so other team members could offer help.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Constantly talk to each other about the project to ensure that the deadlines are not missed. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
